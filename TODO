* Figure out how to handle BaseRelation in Binary ops so that only
  the table name is returned instead of the full SELECT statement

* Add a generator for binary relations

* See if Relation::Unary#dispatch can be overriden, so that when binary/set
  ops are seen, it delegates to a private method, otherwise to super. This
  would remove the need for public methods to handle binary/set ops, which
  seems wrong.

* Change relation generators to accept the relation to the constructor
  and call #visit inside #initialize
  * Include Veritas::Immutable within Relation

* Adjust reek and roodi scores down to lower thresholds

* Handle cases where an Inequality/Exclusion predicate is used (or a
  Negation wrapping an Equality/Inclusion) on an *optional* attribute.
  * Add "OR attribute IS NULL" to the statement to ensure cases when
    the value is NULL still matches.
