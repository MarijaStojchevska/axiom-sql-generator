* Add one spec for each literal corresponding to an Attribute type

* Add specs for binary relations

* Adjust reek and roodi scores down to lower thresholds

* Handle cases where an Inequality/Exclusion predicate is used (or a
  Negation wrapping an Equality/Inclusion) on an *optional* attribute.
  * Add "OR attribute IS NULL" to the statement to ensure cases when
    the value is NULL still matches.

* Make sure SQL generation specs track String object creation to ensure
  no needless Strings are created for any specific operation.
