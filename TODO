* Add one spec for each Attribute type
  * Add a handler for each primitive

* Add specs for binary relations

* Split handlers for primitives, attribute, expression and direction
  into a separate class.
  * Define class methods for each handler
  * In addition to object, pass in the qualified name to use
  * Update Generator.handler so the value is a reference to the
    method object for each handler rather than a symbol name.

* Adjust reek and roodi scores down to lower thresholds

* Handle cases where nil is used in Equality and Inequality predicates
