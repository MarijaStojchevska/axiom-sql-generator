* Add specs for binary relations

* Consider making a Generator::Relation class
  * Move Generator code into it
  * Rename Generator::UnaryRelation to Generator::Relation::Unary
  * Rename Generator::BinaryRelation to Generator::Relation::Binary
  * Generator would provide a factory method that returns either the
    Unary or Binary relation instances depending on the relation
    provided.

* Adjust reek and roodi scores down to lower thresholds

* Handle cases where an Inequality/Exclusion predicate is used (or a
  Negation wrapping an Equality/Inclusion) on an *optional* attribute.
  * Add "OR attribute IS NULL" to the statement to ensure cases when
    the value is NULL still matches.
